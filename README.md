# Darkroom Construction Project Instructions

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Description
The darkroom was initially constructed during the Fall 2024 semester by teaching assistants Samarth Kabbur and Kadhir Vivekanandan for ES301, a course taught by Professor Shannon Stokes. The purpose of the darkroom is to support students in building and testing camera obscuras as part of their coursework. Specifically, the darkroom facilitates light-leak tests and allows for loading film in a controlled, light-free environment, ensuring the integrity of student projects.

This guide provides detailed instructions for replicating the darkroomâ€™s construction, ensuring future students can benefit from this resource.

### 1.2 Scope of Services
To successfully build the darkroom, you will need to perform the following activities:
- *Material Procurement:* Drive to a hardware store (e.g., Home Depot) to purchase necessary materials.
- *Tool Operation:* Safely handle large saws to cut PVC pipes and other materials to the required dimensions.
- *Measurements and Calculations:* Accurately measure and calculate dimensions to ensure proper assembly.
- *Physical Labor:* Safely handle large, heavy, and unwieldy materials during transport and assembly.
- *Elevated Work:* Use a step ladder or have sufficient vertical reach to assemble overhead components.
- *Safety Compliance:* Follow OSHA guidelines for safe working practices throughout the construction process.
- *Assembly and Testing:* Assemble the darkroom according to these instructions, validate its functionality, and perform a success study to ensure all requirements are met.

### 1.3 Funding and Budget
The prototype darkroom was constructed within a budget of $117.54, excluding materials already on hand. Below is an estimated budget breakdown:

| Item                | Quantity | Cost Estimate |
|---------------------|----------|----------------|
| PVC pipes           | Various  | $50-$100       |
| Connectors          | Assorted | $20-$30        |
| Darkroom cloth      | 1 set    | $150-$200      |
| Clamps (large/small)| 20+      | $25-$50        |
| Tape (masking)      | 2 rolls  | $10-$20        |
| Zippers             | 2        | $15-$30        |
| Miscellaneous       | -        | $30-$50        |

If essential materials such as darkroom cloth are not already available, the total budget may range between $300 and $500.

### 1.4 Anticipated Schedule
The prototype took approximately 20-30 person-hours over 2.5 weeks to construct. The following timeline is recommended:
1. *Planning and Procurement:* 2-3 days.
2. *Material Preparation:* 1-2 days.
3. *Assembly:* 2-3 days.
4. *Testing and Refinement:* 2-3 days.

## 2. Success Criteria
The darkroom is considered successful if it meets the following criteria:

1. *Space:* A minimum of two students can stand, move, and work comfortably inside the darkroom.
2. *Structural Integrity:* The exoskeleton is rigid and withstands minor external forces or accidental bumps.
3. *Light Tightness:* The room passes a light-tightness study (see section 3.7 for the testing procedure).
4. *Accessible Entry:* The entrance is easy to operate and includes an effective seal to prevent light leaks.

## 3. Build Instructions

### 3.1 Materials and Tools
- PVC pipes (see section 3b for dimensions)
- Connectors (assorted to match the design)
- Darkroom fabric
- Large and small clamps
- Masking tape
- Zippers (2)
- Tools: saw, measuring tape, step ladder

### 3.2 Cutting PVC Pipes
1. Cut the PVC pipes to the following lengths:
   - *4 pieces:* 48 inches
   - *2 pieces:* 84 inches
   - *2 pieces:* 60 inches
   - *3 pieces:* 12 inches

2. Use a cutting station at the store or workshop to ensure accurate cuts. Verify lengths before proceeding.

### 3.3 Assembly
1. Attach the pipes and connectors as shown in the provided diagram. Ensure the structure encloses a desk or workstation.
2. Place the assembled structure in the designated location for the darkroom.

### 3.4 Draping Fabric
1. Drape the darkroom fabric over the structure, allowing for some overlap.
2. Secure the fabric using large clamps for structural attachment and small clamps for fabric-to-fabric connections.
3. Ensure the fabric fully covers the top, sides, front, and back. Tape any hanging ends to the floor using masking tape.

4. Create a door by overlapping two fabric edges. Drape an additional piece of fabric over the door for a double seal.

### 3.5 Installing Zippers
1. Attach zippers to the outer and inner door seals to facilitate entry and exit. Ensure zippers operate smoothly.

### 3.6 Sealing Light Leaks
1. Enter the darkroom and allow your eyes to adjust.
2. Inspect for light leaks and use masking tape to seal them, especially around corners and seams.
3. Focus on potential trouble spots such as the bottom edges and door seals.

### 3.7 Light Leak Study
1. Place small pieces of film paper in all corners of the darkroom and leave them for 15 minutes.
2. Develop the film. If any piece is exposed (dark), it indicates a light leak in that area.
3. Seal the leak and repeat the study until all film pieces remain unexposed (completely white).
